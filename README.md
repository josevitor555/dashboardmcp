### Project Management Dashboard

A modern task/project management dashboard built with **React**, **TypeScript**, and **Tailwind CSS**, designed to help **freelancers and agencies** organize and prioritize client projects. It includes smart filtering, priority tagging, smooth UI animations, and a powerful AI-assisted context system powered by **MCP**.

### What is MCP?

To build this project, we used a protocol called **MCP Server (Model Context Protocol)** â€” think of it as a living manual or design library for the AI. It acts as a contextual brain: every time you mention `@modal`, `@button`, or `@card`, the assistant instantly understands what UI component to render and how to behave.

Feels like magic? Itâ€™s not â€” itâ€™s **contextual intelligence**.

> It's not just autocomplete. It's co-pilot UI design powered by shared understanding.

### More on MCP

The **MCP Server** is a central component within the Model Context Protocol (MCP) ecosystem. It acts as a bridge between AI models and your projectâ€™s tools, codebase, and data sources.

In this project, MCP enables:

- **Creating layouts** based on design tokens and `shadcn/ui` presets  
- **Context-awareness** for components, styling, and user interactions  
- **Component references** via `@mentions` (e.g., `@card`, `@task`, `@priorityBadge`)

Each MCP server is unique, tailored to the specific needs of the project it serves.

### Authentication *(Coming Soon)*

User authentication will be handled via:

- **MySQL** for user data (registration & login)  
- **JWT** for secure session management  

**Endpoints:**

```http
POST   /api/register-user     â†’ Register new user  
POST   /api/login-user        â†’ Log in  
DELETE /api/logout-account    â†’ Delete user session  
GET    /api/home              â†’ Protected route (JWT required)
```

### Project / Task Management (MongoDB)

```http
POST   /api/register-task     â†’ Create a new task  
PUT    /api/update-task       â†’ Update an existing task  
DELETE /api/delete-task/:id   â†’ Delete task by ID

```
